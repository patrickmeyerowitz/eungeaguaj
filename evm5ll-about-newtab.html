Win7x64Pro, Firefox 19.2 I have the homepage set to have several tabs open when I start Firefox, the last tab has always been "about:newtab" which I find helpful. I'm using this extenstion (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/customize-aboutnewtab/) to customize my newtab The google search bar is not only unwanted, unneeded, but it's also messing up that page. Is there a way I can remove. Гуглил, яндексил, здесь тоже пользовался поиском. Не нашёл. Предлагают только фоновый рисунок поменять. Does anyone know how to or have a link to customize the about:newtab page? What I'm looking to do is resize and add more tiles. I guess that I also don't want Waterfox just adding more and rearranging them just all willy nilly. :D I want a 4x4 grid that fits without having to scroll down through them. I would much rather do this via userChrome.css or userContent.css and not another add-on.

Hi, I want to pin about:sessionrestore to one of the tiles in about:newtab to make it easier to restore a session without going through a bunch of menus. However, when trying this, firefox tells me about:sessionrestore is not a valid url, is there anyway to override it? I tried adding it to browser.newtabpage.pinned but that did nothing, presumably because the page was not shown on any of the tiles to begin with.

Previously my about:newtab/about:home looked like this (https://i.imgur.com/wcXRLFG.png), but now it looks like this (https://i.imgur.com/CIxZQuL.png) (the black squares are just me plastering that over certain webpages). When I look at the inspector it shows it's applying this (https://i.imgur.com/j6q843D.png) to the body. Is there any way to get it to stop doing that? Firefox is still set to use its native dark theme in settings. It would be really nice if f/F worked also on about:newtab. Currently the only way is to use tab which is quite annoying. Screen recording: https://photos.app.goo.gl/EOFOY1fMZ2LUZVIs2 Before I report a bug: has anyone else found the same symptoms? On one hand: - the bug is not yet reproducible in safe mode, so I might suspect an issue with an extension. On the other hand: - whilst URLs such as `about:blank` are described as non-priveleged, and allowed, in the context of `tabs.create()` – https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/create#Parameters – I don't imagine WebExtensions APIs allow. 
Use Search Dimension to control your Google Chrome search engine settings and new tab design.

Hi everyone, currently i write my first extension to create a new tab page, its finished and working great. But i want that my homepage is my new tab page as well, not only for new tabs. My first idea was to set "about…. I tried adding `background: url("file://pathtoimage.jpg") !important;` to userContent.css but it doesn't work. I check in the inspector and the tooltip says "Could not load image". Firefox can load the image when I access `file://pathtoimage.jpg` from URL bar, so the file path is valid. So how can we actually link to local images? Thanks for any help. Edit: I am on Nightly which only allows Web Extension. Sets a custom URL to load in new tabs. Choose from chrome's about pages, NewTab, Extensions, Downloads, History , a few popular URLs, or provide the thing is the main background of the theme has a slight blue tint, and I want to change it to a darker grey. I've managed to change some colors how I wanted by tinkering with userchrome.css but still, the main background doesn't change, the color changes briefly when I open a new window but then reverts back to the default color like this https://i.imgur.com/1lL3YsL.jpg.

Obviously as a user of Nightly, I am going to see things which are still in development. But today's build is very concerning, since similar changes have ended up in the final product. Previously, we have gone from being able to fully customize the layout of about:tab, to the tiles being made a fixed size in Australis. This removal of customization significantly reduced the number of available tiles. As I had it configured, it was reduced from 22 to 12. A later update (now live in Firefox. New Tab - Av Beato Nuno, nº 374 A, 2495-401 Fátima, Portugal - Rated 4.8 based on 39 Reviews "Five star!". Firefox just updated and the about:newtab icon layout has been changed. How do I get back the old 5x3 grid with big icons. Здравствуйте! При открытии браузера Mozilla вверху постоянно выскакивает "Информационное сообщение про сайт about:newtab". It seems so simple to be able to change that. I had addons that did it for me before, but now they're gone. I'm baffled how this new Firefox is all about customization, but we can't change this ugly ass white screen. At least changing the tiles and sites that appear on them is much better. 
New Tab Page feature--- RESOLVED FIXED in  Should you however choose to hack your way around, you'll want to remove the newTab.xul entry in nsSessionStore.js slightly above the place you've modified:. I used to be able to style about:newtab with Stylish, but ever since the switch to WebExtensions, the styling extensions like Stylish or Stylus are not allowed to touch system pages or userchrome. However there is a way to style userchrome and that is with external userChrome.css. Does it work with internal pages, like about:newtab? Is there any way to customize internal pages like about:newtab. On 2/21/2014 4:56 PM, Nicholas Nethercote wrote: > I think there are two cases where you see about:newtab. > > 1.

I've created a folder at C:\TheNessLink\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ my profile default\chrome and inside it is my userContent.css file which contains the following CSS: @-moz-document url("about:newtab") { body { background-color: #000000 !important; } } What that CSS is supposed to do is set the background of the retina-destroying white New Tab page (which can't be themed by extensions anymore) to a soothing full black. What it actually. I am trying to change the background of about:newtab in Firefox using the new WebExtensions API. At the moment, I don't understand why I receive the following error message in the debug console. I did some websearching and so far I found a way to remove all icons by putting: tabbrowser-tab tab-icon-image {visibility: hidden !important;} in userChrome.css. ampnbsp; And through another post (https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/7d1rwn/dark_new_tab/) found that there should be a way to only apply it to certain URLs by using: @-moz-document url("about:home"), url("about:newtab") {  } However combining those two doesn't work, be it my sub-par CSS skills or another. When I open a new tab, it defaults to about:newtab. When I then enter a URL in the address bar and go to it, about:newtab appears in the tab's history. This started happening in Firefox 57. I don't. ^ title.

I know this question has been asked a million times (because I've spent the past hour reading through threads here with the same question), but none of the answers I've read have worked for me. Originally, I was going to use stylus and just add a thing for about:newtab, but since I'm on nightly, addons can't modify 'about:' pages. I screwed around in about:config for a while (this is only semi-related, but just in case anyone was wondering, you can get rid of that annoying flash of white. This week we landed a telemetry probe to get a basic measure of about:newtab impressions.

So basically I have 4 systems installed on my main workstation/gaming box. After I recently upgraded my video card and installed the latest AMD drivers. suddenly Firefox crashes on my Windows systems whenever I open a new tab. This is pissing me off and /r/techsupport is no help so I figured I'd see if anyone else is experiencing this problem with Windows and new AMD R9 cards. I am almost positive it's a Direct X related issue, due to my Linux systems being fine. Anyone know WTF is going. You can open as many tabs as you want in Chrome. You can also view all your tabs and switch among them. Open a new tab On your Android phone, open the Chrome. Hey, I had the idea to use a custom CSS layout for :newtab and :home pages, maybe even with JS, as seen here (https://www.tenlua.vn/backsoon/index.html). Might not be the most poular idea out there, not sure. I haven't found how to alter said page's layout yet. Any ideas on how I could achieve that? Thanks, jhfpc. 
301 Moved The document has moved. I've been using FF beta for a couple weeks and the about:newtab changed not long ago, the problem I have with the current one is that it seems to update the thumbnail of the websites once and never refresh it, so all I have are previews of login pages of those websites. Is there a way to force refresh the thumbnails or updating them manually. You can use the "Search" bar at the top of the about:config page ("Filter" bar in older versions) to filter the preferences that you want to inspect. The search bar is case-insensitive, unlike the actual configuration variables. Some examples to filter results: browser.tabs. newtab.

                            <p> So I set to record Brooklyn Nine Nine. However where most shows I record I can watch immediately, B99 seems to be delayed by a week. E.G. I JUST watched the episode that aired 4/11 it just showed up today. Th episode that aired yesterday is not there. Is this a PSVue issue o an NBC issue. Seriously what the fuck is going on? I recorded ALL of the Formula 1 races for last season and this current season. When I went to watch the recorded Chinese GP qualifying this morning, myDVR is showing NO F1 recordings. Instead I am seeing a blank (i) icon with text that says - No Results. When I try to add F1 to myDVR, it asks me if I want to REMOVE F1 from myDVR. Seriously what the fuck am i paying. I "record" around 40 shows in MyDVR and have it ordered by air date. The only show that I watch every single day no matter what is PTI. I would expect PTI, which airs every day, to be at the top of the list, but it is always near the bottom. Is there a way to reverse the sort that I am just missing? I want PTI to be on my main page every. Really hard to figure out. How do I select the stations I want as favorites and block out those I don't want? I was in CNN and tried to get out to the menu of stations using the back arrow (top left of Roku remote). Each time it gave me only the option to leave or stay on PSV. How do I select a show I always want to record? Is there a user manual that tells you all this? I am a YTTV user and kind of think for  more he CORE option is a good deal cause it includes NFL. Anyway, it seems 
In the last few weeks, MyDVR has been consistently failing to load on both PS4 and iPhone (95% failure rate, and if it doesn't load the first time, it never will). However, MyDVR loads every time when vueing in a browser. On the PS4: I deleted my Vue app cache, deleted and reinstalled the app, renewed licenses for all my PS store purchases, restarted the machine. still nothing. On the iPhone: I've done a software update, ensured the app is the newest version, deleted and reinstalled When using MyDVR the games that go into extra time are cut off such as U20 Uruguay/Portugal last night and Germany/Zambia before that. How can I make sure the entire game is recorded (iOS 10) and not cut off at 105 minutes? Also how to access DVR from Roku I can only see the option on my phone app it's very inconvenient not to be able to watch from TV-when will this be fixed? Thank. New to Vue and liked the fact the DVR functions and the fact I could receive locals are much better than DirectvNow. amp#x200B; I've set several shows to record such as local news and national news as well as a few network shows. I did this two days ago and they are not recording. When I go to the show in the MyDVR screen they appear and show the next day to record but nothing ever shows up. What could I possibly be doing? I'm 2 days in with the 5 day free trial. Thanks. I'm interested in what you all think because I can tell immediately that in it's present state, the AppleTV TV app is just not something I can see myself using. I genuinely embrace the idea of consolidating all my available content in one location with no need for switching from app to app. Right now, I spend 80% of my time in the PS Vue app and then the other 20% in the netflix app or other media apps. The current implementation of the TV app puts me into a whole slew of content including. 
trying to cast mydvr shows off of ipad to chromecast gen 1. PSV will connect, when i try to play content, it immediately says thanks for watching, please choose another show. any idea? i've uninstalled and reinstalled So to set this up since I had to edit very key gameplay out of the vid. I managed to escape on pure skills. Come right back as tommy as the others are approaching the exit. Jason waved me off for whatever reason. The rest.pure gold Edit After watching back the orignal I realized how bad it really was. Here the clip on mydvr http://xboxdvr.com/gamer/K3ys3r%20S0z3/video/33875126. hi- i'd like to expand the storage capacity on my roamio. i know i can buy a wd my dvr expander. they are expensive tho. does anyone know if i can just buy a wd mybook and then get a usb to esata converter? there are wd mybook 4tb drives for the same price as a wd mydvr expander 1tp drive. i'd like th 4tb option. Text from an actual email I just received from Comcast after complaining that the online dvr manager doesn't work in my "area" even though I got a thing in the mail advertising it: "Dear Michael, Thank you for contacting Comcast cable. My name is Jerico and I appreciate you taking the time to send us a message through email regarding your myDVR inquiry. I understand you would like to know the exact launching of myDVR in your area. I know how important it is for you to verify this information.

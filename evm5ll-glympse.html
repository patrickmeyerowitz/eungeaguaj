 Get directions, reviews and information for Glympse in Seattle In June I'm riding a Century event. (100 mile ride, the cycling equivalent of running a marathon) I was hoping to find an app to live share my GPS location that could allow friends and family to watch my race progress, maybe send me messages or something. Obviously there are plenty of apps for sharing GPS tracking after the ride. And I've found some apps where the event host purchases and hand out trackers to attendees. But I'm just looking to share for my personal circle. Anyone Glympse. 9,593 likes · 5 talking about this. Glympse is the only built-for-mobility SaaS company that helps Fortune 1000 companies improve their customer. Recently, I've noticed that Glympse will not automatically send through SMS. It switches to the SMS app and then I have to click send. This works ok when it's only one person, but it is problematic when sending to more than one person because it does not start a second message. Is anyone else seeing. Description Glympse is a mobile application that allows friends and family to safely share their live location and ETA with each other Hi, My friend is going to be running a marathon soon and has asked to borrow my watch, I was wondering if there was a way I could track it remotely while he's running so when we go to watch, we can see that he's coming up soon so we don't miss him. Anyone know a way to do that? Thanks.

About us. Glympse is a team of people passionate about using location to improve consumer experiences. We are proud to have pioneered temporary, safe and secure location-sharing a decade. Is there a way to go from a dictionary to JSON? Just doing a url encode doesn’t seem to work. The use case is that I’m trying to use the Glympse API. https://developer.glympse.com/docs/core/app/schema/reference Thanks. Hey guys! Some background. I have 4 drivers with 4 vehicles that I constantly need to keep track of in regards to their ETA to their destinations. My clients call in for an ETA, I call my driver through their bluetooth speaker in their car and they give me their approx location to which I forward back to my clients. Sometimes it's accurate. And when it's not, it's a pain in the ass on both my end and on my clients. Originally, I wanted to launch an app for both my clients When Google announced location sharing I was so excited, I thought I could get rid of Glympse and just use Google Maps. When the feature finally became available, it was very glitchy and kinda half working. Unfortunately, months later, that still is the case. I compared Google Maps Location Sharing and Glympse about a week ago and Glympse provides so much better experience. With Google Maps the tracking is not real time, it is very delayed, it constantly cuts out and I noticed that unless I check on my wife's commute to see when she'll be home and I just noticed today it shows me her battery percentage is at 80%. I don't remember hearing about this elsewhere. Had a dream that I ended up on a small island, it was vivd and beautiful: all deep rocky and grey stone, deep green grass and moss, going to a place that was something like home, maybe not my home, but it felt like some kind of sanctuary. It was the only structure on the island, as though the ocean had left enough space for this house and a lawn and a few tiny islands around it, There were all kinds of birds and tiny replicas of the environments that they liked and lived in on the little islands. I realize it may not be the biggest feature for everyone, but the Glympse feature is handy to share ETA/location with family and friends when going on longer road trips. It seems that the functionality works intermittently, mainly the send from the contacts menu. It does eventually send a notification (SMS) that works to share the drive, but it's liable to spam the person with 5-20 texts (versus the single one when Navdy was in business). I don't know what SDK/API Navdy uses for this there's. Hey All, Really struggling in creating a shortcut to send a text to my wife when I'm coming home and driving directions via Waze. Could someone share a shortcut with me so I just have to put my information in. amp#x200B;. just wondering if the canned replied like "I am driving" work for sending replies to messages on iOS and iMessage for anyone else? I haven't been able to get them working. just checking, also do they work on Android? amp#x200B; Running the 3059.1 firmware. 
We have a case in the family. He goes out walking for errands, and has lost track of time and location a couple of times (and he is aware of it, so he also likes sharing his location). His wife was getting very anxious every time he went out. Now she (ans his daughter) can see his whereabouts on Google Maps on her phone. In Android, you can even set up a shortcut on the home screen with the person's name and picture that takes you directly to his/her Google Maps location, which makes Newby (to Shortcuts) here. Just an example. Say I'd like to create a shortcut for (1) opening Glympse, (2) choosing to share my location with the hubby (3) for the duration of one hour and (4) sending that link by (5) copy/paste into Whatsapp, Shortcuts can't do much more than open Glympse. Is there a more appropriate place to request app recommendations? My family, friends, and I have used Glympse for years for location sharing. In recent months, however, the location displayed to the recipient(s) has been significantly delayed, and often hysterically inaccurate. Can anyone suggest a worthwhile replacement with similar functionality? And if there's a better place to post this, please educate me! Thanks. I am sure you guys know this but thought it was cool it worked. Someone sent me a Glympse and clicking the link worked. I guess it's built in the Tizen software. Also it's not static, so you see the arrow moving just like the phone. After I bought my phone my parents demanded that I share my location with them 24/7 and I did not want to do that so they threatened to cancel the phone plan that I pay for and take away my phone that I paid full MSRP price for. Sadly because constantly transmitting my location takes up a lot of battery I turned airplane mode on and when I finally turned it back off I got a threatening voicemail from my mother demanding that I come home and that I am grounded from leaving the house. Last night, I sent a friend my location through Glympse via text on my LG G6 paired with my new forerunner 735xt. A few moments later, it started forwarding notifications to my watch, constantly, about once a second. It kept the watch screen lit, ate 5% of my battery life in the 10 minutes I had to wait to find a place to pull over, and all I could see were the Glympse notifications. This is something I sent , not something I received. I couldn't even get into the watch menu because In-Dash Navigation AV Receiver with 6.1 WVGA Touchscreen Display, Built-In Bluetooth , and AppRadio Mode for iPhone 4 and iPhone.

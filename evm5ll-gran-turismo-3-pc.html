Lamborghini and Bugatti make their first home-console appearance in the franchise, following their introduction in Gran Turismo PSP, new "gullwing" Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG appeared, along with the Ferrari 458 Italia and the Lexus LFA supercar.

I've been wanting Gran Turismo on PC for quite some time. I play with a controller and after years of GRID and NFS Shift, a tease of PCars 1 and Forza APEX, all of a sudden I'm eating and I got options! I've been playing PCars 2 since launch and Forza 7 since it unlocked for suckers. For the record I thought Forza APEX felt better than PCars 1 on a controller. Not all cars, but overall. Then PCars2 came along and, for me, changed the game with the new braking feeling. I can actually "slam". The Logitech Driving Force GT is an official racing wheel peripheral designed for racing games on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and Windows PCs. It is manufactured and distributed by Logitech International S.A of Romanel-sur-Morges, Switzerland. The traditional driving game career mode has been focused on getting licenses, earning money, then buying cars and their upgrades. It copies the RPG formula almost exactly. You feel powerful, progress, get all the things and beat the game. While that’s fun it doesn’t cause people to drive realistically, and the idea of realism is what drives most players towards your Forzas, Gran Turismos, and PC racing sims. But in these games lust for power and progress often causes suicidal driving 1 Congregazione per il Clero, Direttorio Generale per la Pastorale del Turismo (30.4.1969). 2 Giovanni Paolo II, Messaggio per la Giornata Mondiale del Turismo del 2000, 5. 3 Statistiche fornite dall’Organizzazione Mondiale del Turismo (OMT), il 30 gennaio. I used to play a lot of Gran Turismo on my PS3 back in the day. Now that I'm on PC I am looking for a game like Gran Turismo. I personally do not like arcade racers. Does anyone know games similar to Gran Turismo (( (Free) Libre De Cellulite Beaute Nue 55$ (usd) Par Vente (Buyer Review) Search Result: )@ (Download) Libre De Cellulite Beaute Nue 55$ (usd) Par Vente (Coupon Code) - Click Here To Get More Info About Libre De Cellulite Beaute Nue 55$ (usd) Par Vente ( - Click Here To Get More Info About Libre De Cellulite Beaute Nue 55$ (usd). 
Looking for a game similar to Forza or Gran Turismo on PC, LOTS of cars ranging from what you can buy at a dealership to full blown racing cars, more simulator inspired racing instead of NFS arcade style. Surely something like this exists on PC? Closest I found was Test Drive Unlimited, more arcade style driving but fun collecting  So my PS3 just broke, I recently built a computer so I'm not looking to buy another PS3 anytime soon, but I've got the itch for a simulation style racing game. So long story short there anything like Gran Turismo e.g. You start by buying and modifying cheaper/slower cars and slowly work your way up. Something about that progression feels better to me than the usual xp route that the Dirt/GRID franchises. Was looking into getting Project CARS as hopefully a Gran Turismo for PC more or less. I can't always have my Logitech MOMO racing wheel and pedals with me, so I'd be playing it with an XBONE controller also. How's the game itself, and does it work okay with console controllers? I've also already got GRID: Autosport, so is it worth getting TL;DR: I need tips of realistic racing games with loads of cars in it. I tried to search the interwebs for answers. What i am searching after. A game much like Forza/Gran Turismo for PC. Simple game that either have a large selection of vehicles from the start or the ability to add in cars (mods). Also real tracks are prefered. Specs: AMD E-450 APU 1.65 GHz Dual Core Radeon HD 6320 4 Gb RAM I've tried most racing games out there as of date. Closest thing i could get was Need for Speed. 
GT3 is a top5 game for me. I played a lot back in the days but sadly I never had the chance to max it out (got like 99.6%). I gave it a try, I wanted to know how developed is the emulator and what my new pc can do. To my biggest surprise, It runs a stable 50fps even in 4k resolution. That was one of my happiest day in my life. Every pound I put into my build. is worth. Here is a video. https://youtu.be/VHSZhJK-FeU (ofc its only 1080p30fps This is old. I have an updated thread here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/146bda/usah_cosmo_black_3ds_system_paper_mario_sticker/. My Android account got the update. Here is the schedule for the 2.4 update. New Cars 1993 Porsche RWB 993 2018 Maserati Gran Turismo 2017 Spyker C8 Preliator 2018 Bugatti Chiron Sport 110 ans Bugatti 2019 SSC Tuatara 2013 FampF Flip Car Season 76 S/M - Porsche 911 RWB PC - Audi R8 V10 Plus Coupé(T5) Gold/Evo Cup/Event - Bugatti Chiron(Prize - Bugatti Chiron Sport 110 ans Bugatti)/Aston Martin DB11 + Jaguar C-X75(Duality Cup) Season 77 S/M - Maserati. Updated the schedule in the sidebar. For those using the mobile site or a mobile app you can find it in the Community Info. Note: For those that may be using the Redesign, I currently can’t update the Season Schedule widget. Haven’t been able to for about a couple months. Reddit Admins broke the custom CSS widgets a while back and until they fix that, I can’t do anything with them. As soon as this is fixed I will update the widget. If you want/need the season schedule Please note , this is for those who follow me primarily through the War Thunder reddit. I apologise in advance for the potential for this post to appear as spam. With that. I hope you are all keeping well. I appreciate many of you may be wondering why I have stopped making War Thunder videos, bought myself a Playstation 4 (PS4), and then suddenly started making Gran Turismo Sport videos. In short, back in September 2018 my Dad was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Following treatment I have an XBOX ONE, Wii, Switch, 2DS (belongs to my lil brother) and Gaming PC. But what I don't have is a PlayStation, so I've been considering my options. The PS1 graphics have aged poorly imo. The PS2 seems like a good choice, but it's not in HD and I kinda want my next conole to be a media hub. The PS4 seems good, but the price is too much and there is no backwards compatibility. The PS3 on the other hand seems like a good middle ground. The graphics are a bit dated, but it's quite cheap. 
Ello all. Is there a game for PC or PS4 which has a good career mode like how Forza 3 or the Gran Turismo games where you slowly do tracks and upgrade the car. I would prefer to use my G29 wheel but it's not a deal breaker. Gallery of the items I'm selling (https://imgur.com/a/vC1Tco0).

Hey guys, amp#x200B; I'm a big fan of the Horizon series of Forza and therefore also a big fan of Forza Horizon 4. I've also loved playing Gran Turismo 4 and 5 back when I had a Playstation, but now I've moved to PC. I'm quite into the realistic kind of racing, sim damage, no break assists, no traction control, all that stuff and am looking at FM7. 1. Now for the players that are playing FM7 AND FH4, is there a big difference in control in each vehicle for FM7 compared 1. \gt\ \ What will you be doing with this PC?
